# Simple-Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables. Note: In this article, we refer dependent variables as response and independent variables as features for simplicity. In order to provide a basic understanding of linear regression, we start with the most basic version of linear regression, i.e. Simple linear regression.   Simple Linear Regression Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x)
