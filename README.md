# Simple-Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables. Note: In this article, we refer dependent variables as response and independent variables as features for simplicity. In order to provide a basic understanding of linear regression, we start with the most basic version of linear regression, i.e. Simple linear regression.   Simple Linear Regression Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x)

1st

Problem Statement: -

A certain food based company conducted a survey with the help of a fitness company spread across the country to find  relationship between a person’s weight gain and the no of calories consumed by them in order to come up a diet plan for individuals that fall under different weight groups. Approach - A Simple Linear regression model needs to be built with target variable ‘Calories.Consumed’. Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE values, Correlation coefficient values for different transformation models.

Problem Statement: - A food delivery service recorded the data of  delivery time taken and the time taken for the deliveries to be sorted by the restaurants in order to improve their delivery services. Approach – A Simple Linear regression model needs to be built with target variable ‘Delivery.Time’. Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE values, Correlation coefficient values for different transformation models.
